# agriculture-ml-analysis
This project aims to analyze and predict agricultural crop production trends in India using historical data from 2001 to 2014. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest Regression, the model forecasts crop yield based on factors like crop type, state, cost of cultivation, and production inputs.

The dataset, sourced from data.gov.in, includes key agricultural indicators such as:

Crop and variety
Cultivation state and recommended zone
Cost of cultivation and production
Yield per hectare

This project helps in understanding crop performance patterns across states and supports better planning in agriculture by offering data-driven insights.
Key Features:
Data preprocessing & cleaning
One-hot encoding of categorical variables
Model training using Random Forest Regressor
Evaluation with MSE and RÂ² metrics
Visualization of predicted vs. actual crop yields

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Machine Learning (Regression)
